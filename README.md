# Tilted_BLI_Engine
Design and Analysis of a Short-Takeoff-andLanding UAV Based on Tilted Boundary Layer Ingestion Engines

This is a project towards zero-emission freight drones in urban areas (with the example of cross-district transportation in Shanghai). Inspired by Lilium Jet, we explored the possibility of a non-moving boundary layer ingestion engine for short-distance landing/takeoff instead of VTOL and discussed the effect of the installation tilt and position on the final performance on a NACA 5-digit foil.

It is a short investigation conceived in Jan. 2024 and completed in Feb. 2024 in response to the Genius Olympiad selection event in Shanghai. Due to arrangement reasons, our team did not attend the final event. 

I am in charge of the conceptualization, modeling, and experiment of this research. My partner Ningzi Chen is in charge of data processing and writing. Our mentor is Prof. Daqing Huang (NUAA).
